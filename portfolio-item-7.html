            <p>你的运动量现在有多大呢？无论你想参加奥运会或者只是想保持自己的身心健
                康，能够找到自己喜爱的运动确实有无数种好处。你在篮球或者乒乓球场上能够遇到
                来自不同背景志同道合的朋友。打一场篮球比赛、在跑道上奔跑五公里会为你带来充
                分的成就感，从而让你从早晨一直到黄昏时有更多精神，更多快乐。特别在现代日新
                月异、平凡飘忽的社会里，运动在你的生活中会带来更多常规。</p>

            <p>Physical movement is important in more ways than one. Whether at a competitive
                level or simply as a hobby, finding a sport to enjoy is so crucial to maintaining one’s
                happiness. Not only does sport bring people from different backgrounds together, playing
                sport also provides a sense of accomplishment that stays with you throughout the day and the
                week. Especially in such an uncertain, rapidly changing world, sport can bring you a constant
                routine to fall back on.</p>
            <p>
                如今，很多科学研究已经证明了运动量以及快乐心情的正相关。童年时，我们
的运动量比较大，经常会到朋友家去打足球、玩捉迷藏类似的游戏。但岁月流逝，我
们逐渐的开始忽略运动在我们生活中的角色，说服自己没有时间在外面活动。其实养
成定期运动的习惯是一种正强化的概念 --- 在生活中有更多运动
            </p>

            <p>Countless scientific studies have demonstrated a positive correlation between physical
                activity and happier moods, perhaps partially explaining why the youth (who make more time
                for exercise) seem to have boundless energy. It’s a positive reinforcement cycle, where more
                exercise leads to more energy, which leads to more exercise. Even a few jumping jacks or a
                brief trot around the block in the morning can help you get the endorphins going, and it
                doesn’t take a world class scientist to figure out that this is good for you.</p>

            <p>
                如何能够找到时间去运动呢？
            </p>
            <p>
                One might ask, how do I find time for this? How do I fit an already busy, hectic and
stressful schedule and professional life with consistent exercise? It turns out that that it really
doesn’t take much. 30 minutes in a day, that’s all it takes. Finish your work for the day, drink
a bottle of water, grab a banana and go. Find a regular route to run, a mountain to hike or
pool to swim in. The benefits of half an hour of exercise more than compensates the opportunity cost of the same amount of lost time at work. Maintaining one’s health in such a
regular manner thwarts off disease and could potentially add months and years to one’s
lifespan. We often cite concepts such as genetics, hormonal imbalance or hypothyroidism as
causal factors for conditions such as obesity – but it’s important to not forget the basics:
Drink enough water, sleep well and exercise frequently.

            <p>
                If governments around the world really wanted to increase the productivity of their
                workforce, I would recommend placing less emphasis on funding political campaigns,
                convoluted bureaucratic systems or dream about the currently out of reach capabilities of
                artificial intelligence. I would recommend keeping things simple. Just by giving their citizens
                time to pursue fulfilling and healthy activities like exercise, our communities will be so much
                happier.
