            <p>
                A Vickrey auction is a spin on the traditional notion of an auction, where
a group of individuals bid successively higher prices to purchase a good that has
been placed on sale. What happens is that all of the bidders submit their bids on
a slip of paper without knowledge of anyone else’s bid price – the highest
bidder obtains the good but only needs to pay the price of the second highest
bid. This type of auctioning system is supposedly socially optimal, by giving
bidders an incentive to put forth exactly their own valuations for said good; and
if not, harming themselves by the exact amount of deviation from this value.
For example, say an individual is willing to put forth at most 50USD to
purchase a particular textbook for the course that they are taking next semester.
If they bid a value of 55USD, they run the risk of overpaying past their
threshold of tolerance by < 5USD, as the second highest bidder could
potentially bid between 51 – 54 USD. In a similar vein, suppose the individual bids only 45USD and loses the bid to someone who put forth 49USD. The
highest bidder now only needs to pay 45USD and obtains the textbook, which
was a situation that our individual would have been happy to be in. In either
case, they run the risk of losing out on the optimal scenario if they do not place
forward their true valuation. 
            </p>

            <p>
                Whilst in theory this form of auction is quite appealing, it is quite
difficult to implement practically. Bidders are often unwilling to disclose their
information to a third party (auctioneer) and may not trust what they say about
the second-highest bid. As a result, other auction implementations are more
common in the real world. The First Price Sealed Bid Auction simply mandates
that the highest bidder pays whatever price that they put forward. This has been
shown to be game-theoretically equivalent to the Dutch Auction, which initiates
a price that the auctioneer sets, that is continually lowered until a bidder accepts
the current price. Both auctions hinge upon the tradeoff between the price that a
bidder needs to pay and the probability of holding the highest bid, implying
equivalent Bayesian Nash equilibrium bid functions.

                Paul Milgrom studied Vickrey Auctions and formulated the linkage
                principle throughout his tenure at Northwestern, forming the canon of much of
                modern-day auction theory. Much of this theoretical work influences the way
                you and I live and work on a daily basis – the way amazon prices its goods, the
                way Google Search operates, whether AT&T or Verizon gets priority over
                broadcast signals and more. Auctions are everywhere and having an awareness
                of how they work will do wonders.
